This is the configuration for the OpenAFS buildbot master.

This is to be deployed as a subdirectory of the master's basedir.  The
master.cfg is a symlink, from the buildbot master base directory to this
configuration directory.

  $basedir/buildbot.tac
          /twistd.log
          /master.cfg -> afsbotcfg/master.cfg
          /afsbotcfg/.git
                    /master.cfg
                    /passwords
                    /__init__.py
                    /slave.py
                    /...

The build slave passwords are stored in the `passwords' file, which is ignored
by git. The `passwords' file should contain one slavename/password per line,
for each slave in the master.cfg. The slavename and password should be
separated by a space.
